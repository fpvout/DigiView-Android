## Known Issues
- **You might need to set Auto temp control off on your Vista/Air unit (under Settings > Device in goggle menu) to get it to work**.
- Some people reported it's working best in 50mbps mode
- Concerning hardware, USB-C to USB-C cables sometimes don't work depending the phone you're using. in that case, an USB OTG adapter is the best option.
- You *may* need to activate USB OTG in your Android settings to get the fpv goggles detected.
