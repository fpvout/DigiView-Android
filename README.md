## Download
You can download the **Alpha** Release [here](https://github.com/fpvout/fpv_viewer_android/releases/download/v0.1.0/DigiView_0.1.0_ALPHA.apk).

**Note:** App is still in development so you might run into some bugs or even a crash.

## Instructions
- Power on your googles.
- Power on your drone.
- Plug the USB cable from your goggles into your phone (if using an OTG adapter, that goes into your phone).
- Automatic launch is enabled so app should launch. If not, just launch app manually.
- Wait a bit and video should start streaming.
- If there is no video after a few seconds, it's frozen or slowed down, try to unplug the USB cable and plug it back in.

If there is any other issues, please check our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uGYMNByeTH), some people might help you there.

## Known Issues
- **You might need to set Auto temp control off on your Vista/Air unit (under Settings > Device in goggle menu) to get it to work**.
- Some people reported it's working best in 50mbps mode
- Concerning hardware, USB-C to USB-C cables sometimes don't work depending the phone you're using. in that case, an USB OTG adapter is the best option.
- You *may* need to activate USB OTG in your Android settings to get the fpv goggles detected.
